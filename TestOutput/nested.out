     This  checks if all of the nestings

work with single in various locations. A

Basic  file  that  checks  to see if the

centering  command works correctly. Note

that   the   double   backslash   should

indicate what should be centered and how

it is centered. 

      Single is for Single spacing
  Verbatim allows text produced as is
  Itemize uses ticks to indicate items
  Center allows a block to be centered

     Now,  make sure that double spacing

is active again! 

 Single is for spacing Verbatim allows

               text as is

 Itemize has ticks for items Center is

             for centering

     A  block  of  a  enumerate within a

single  environment  should  change  the


                    5

spacing from its double default.

     1. Single is for Single spacing
     2.   Verbatim   allows   text  that
     matches  the  what  you see is what
     you get mode
     3.  Itemize  uses ticks to indicate
     items
     4.  Center  allows  a  block  to be
     centered

     Now,  make sure that double spacing

is active again! 

     1. Single is for Single spacing

     2.  Single is for Single spacing. A

     second level of enums!!!!

     3.  Center  allows  a  block  to be

     centered

     A  block  of  a  itemize  within  a

double   environment   should   maintain

spacing! 

     - Single is for Single spacing

     - Verbatim allows text that matches

     the  what  you  see is what you get

     mode

     -  Itemize  uses  ticks to indicate

                    6

     items

     Now  try  a  single nested block of

two levels with an enumerate inside! 

     - Single is for Single spacing
          I.   Single   is   for  Single
          spacing
          II.  Verbatim allows text that
          matches  the  what  you see is
          what you get mode
          III.  Itemize  uses  ticks  to
          indicate items
          IV.  Center  allows a block to
          be centered
     - Verbatim allows text that matches
     the  what  you  see is what you get
     mode
     -  Itemize  uses  ticks to indicate
     items
     -  Center  allows  a  block  to  be
     centered

     Checking  that  a  simple switch to

single  is  working.  In this case, upon

encountering   the   single  block,  the

spacing should be changed.

Single  is  for  Single spacing Verbatim
allows  text  that  matches  the Itemize
uses  ticks  to  indicate  items  Center
allows a block to be centered

Notice  that all of the whitepace should

be  removed and at this point, we should

                    7

return  to whatever the spacing had been

originally set to. 

     Checking  that  a  simple  verbatim

works correctly! 

          Single is for Single spacing
    Verbatim allows       text   that matches the
    Itemize   uses ticks to   indicate items
    Center   allows a   block to be centered

     Does  this start off correctly with

1 and does it reset after verbatim?
