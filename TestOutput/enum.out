     A  block  of  a  enumerate within a


single  environment  should  change  the


spacing from its triple default. 


     1. Single is for Single spacing


     2.   Verbatim   allows   text  that


     matches  the  what  you see is what


     you get mode


     3.  Itemize  uses ticks to indicate


     items


     4.  Center  allows  a  block  to be


     centered


     Now,  make sure that triple spacing


                    vii

is active again! 


     1. Single is for Single spacing


          ~   Single   is   for   Single


          spacing. A nested itemize


          ~  Verbatim  allows  text that


          matches  the  what  you see is


          what you get mode


          ~   Itemize   uses   ticks  to


          indicate items


          ~  Center allows a block to be


          centered


     2.   Verbatim   allows   text  that


     matches  the  what  you see is what


     you get mode

          spacing.  A  second  level  of


          enums!!!!
