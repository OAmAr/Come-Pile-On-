This is an example of text that would be

transformed  into  a paragraph in latex.

Blank  lines  between  text in the input

cause  a  new paragraph to be generated.

When  the  blank  line  occurs  after  a

section, no indentation of the paragraph

is performed. However, all other blanks,

would  result  in a five space indent of


                    5

the   paragraph.  When  the  blank  line

of  the paragraph is performed. However,

all other blanks, would result in a five

space indent of the paragraph. 

Now,  its  important  to  make sure that
single  works correctly, and can be used
to  change the formating with respect to
the ways lines are output. In this case,
we  are  going  from  double  to  single
spacing.



1.1 A Text Processor

A  text processor is a very useful tool,

since

it   allows   us  to  develop  formatted

documents that are easy to read.

1.2 Legal Latex Commands

We   have   seen  that  there  are  many

different  Latex  commands,  that can be

used  in  many  different ways. However,

sometimes, we wish to use a character to

mean  itself,  and  override  its  Latex

interpretation.   For  example,  to  use

curly  braces, we employ the backslash a

set of integers. 



1.3 Again Legal Latex Commands

different  Latex  commands,  that can be

used  in  many  different ways. However,

sometimes, we wish to use a character to

mean  itself,  and  override  its  Latex

interpretation.   For  example,  to  use

curly  braces, we employ the backslash a

set of integers. 



1.4 Yet Some More Legal Latex Commands

used  in  many  different ways. However,
sometimes, we wish to use a character to
mean  itself,  and  override  its  Latex
interpretation.   For  example,  to  use
curly  braces, we employ the backslash a

2 Using Latex

Finally,  there  are[3m  many  other useful[0m

commands  that involve begin end blocks,

that  establish  an  environment.  These

blocks  behave  in  a similar fashion to

begin   end   blocks  in  a  programming

language,  since  they  set  a scope. We

have discussed a number of examples. 

    [3m  It  is  important to note, even at

this  early  stage,  that  lists  may be


                    8

created   within   lists,  allowing  the

nesting of blocks and environments.[0m
