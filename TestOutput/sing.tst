     Checking  that  a  simple switch to

single  is  working.  In this case, upon

encountering   the   single  block,  the

spacing should be changed.

Single  is  for  Single spacing Verbatim
allows  text  that  matches  the Itemize
uses  ticks  to  indicate  items  Center
allows a block to be centered

Notice  that all of the whitepace should

be  removed and at this point, we should

return  to whatever the spacing had been

originally set to.
