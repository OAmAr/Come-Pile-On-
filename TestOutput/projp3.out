The third and final part of the semester
project focuses on the actual generation
of  formatted  output  from Latex input.
There are 5 tasks for this project, with
the  divisions  given  to  differentiate
between  required  work point totals and
bonuses.  Note that you[3m MUST[0m utilize the[3m
union[0m  command  to  redefine the parsing
stack  in  yacc  bison.  This project is
worth  100  points  with  up to 15 bonus
points. The tasks for the project are:
     1.     Basic     Text    Processing

     5.  Bonus  B:  Full-Blown Verbatim:
     All  possible  Latex  commands that
     are  embedded  in  a verbatim block
     (e.g., backslash, blocks, etc.) are
     ignored.
     The   directory[3m  home  ug1  demurjs
CSE244.SP94  Part3[0m  contains a number of
important files, including: 
         latex.l       : A common latex lex file.
         latexp3.y     : A yacc specification where verbatim works.
         latexp3code.y : A yacc specification with sample code generation.
         util.c        : A number of C utility routines.
         generate.c    : A number of routines used to generate code.
     Portions  of  these and other files
will  be  discussed  in class. The third
part  of  the  project is due on Monday,
May   2,   1994.   Please  hand  in  the
following:
     1. The yacc bison specification for
     tasks 1, 2, and 3. DO NOT HAND IN C
     files!  Also  include copies of any
     relevant  C  files.  Make sure that
     these  are  well-commented,  clear,
     and organized.
     2.  Documentation  of your solution
     that  includes: (1) any assumptions
     that  you make regarding the output
     format  and  style of your document
     (e.g.,    margins,    page   number
     locations,   handling  underlining,
     etc.)  (2)  a  log  file that keeps
     track  of  all of your major design
     steps,  implementation  strategies,
     problems   encountered   (with  lex
     yacc)  and their solutions, aspects
     of the project that were easy hard,
     changes   that  were  made  to  the
     grammar, etc. The key word is MAJOR
     design  steps. NOTE AGAIN THAT YOUR

                    2

     DOCUMENTATION   MUST  BE  GENERATED
     USING YOUR LATEX COMPILER!!!!
     3.  Test cases and test results for
     all   tasks,   clearly  marked  and
     organized.
     4.  The directory location for your
     files   and   detailed  compilation
     instructions.
