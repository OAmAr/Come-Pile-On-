     The  project  for  the  Spring 1994
Semester  will  focus  on the design and
implementation  of  a  Latex  subset for
text   processing.   Specifically,  this
project  will  be  subdivided into three
major parts.
     1. Design and develop a contex free
     grammar   (CFG)  for  a  subset  of
     Latex.
     2.  Design, implement, and test the
     common CFG (which I will provide to
     you  at  a  later  date)  using Lex
     (Flex) and Yacc (Bison).
     3.  Design,  implement,  and test a
     syntax-directed translator based on
     part 2 that automatically generates
     formatted  ASCII text from an input
     Latex source file.
The first part of the project is divided
into two major tasks.
     - Design a CFG for the project that
     allows  Latex  programs (e.g., text
     to  be formatted) to be recognized.
     This    will   provide   you   with
     important      language      design
     experience.
     -  Calculate  FIRST  and FOLLOW for
     the non-terminals listed below:
latex statement    main body        main option      text option
latex options      backs options    begin end opts   begin block
begin end cmds     table options    
Neither  of  these  tasks require you to
develop and or implement code.[3m This is a
design  project!!![0m The first part of the
project is worth 50 points.

semester project, a detailed overview of
the   Latex   subset   that   youll   be
implementing   has   been  attached.  An
