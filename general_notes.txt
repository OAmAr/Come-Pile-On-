1. TOC
    When flag is on, if you see section, render it and also print to TOC
    else, render it
2. Words?
    Why does nothing print correctly. 
    got words to print by adding in latex.l strcpy(yylval.trans, yytext), should I have to?
3. Section headers
    3 newlines, should be two
    issue comes from latex.l
